## Instructions

Follow the instructions in the comments below.

manufactory.js
```javascript
/*
  Create a function named Car with one property named `manufactured_date`
  whose value will be Date.now()
 */
function Car () {
  // Create the manufactured date property (see above)
}

/*
  Create a constructor function named Make with one
  argument that will hold the manufacturer of the Make (see below).

  Set its prototype to a new instance of the Car function.

  Define a property `manufacturer` and assign the
  manufacturer property to the argument value.
 */
function Make (maker) {
  this.manufacturer = maker;

 */
function Chevrolet (name) {
  this.modelName = name;
}
Chevrolet.prototype = new Make("GM");

/*

    above and pass in the string value of the model.
*/
function Camaro () {

// Set the prototype to appropriate model you created above and set the model name argument
Camaro.prototype = new Chevrolet("Camaro");

/*
    Being an avid car collector, you own three different cars all of
    same model from your favorite manufacturer.

    Create three new instances for each of your three favorite cars.

    Create a new property on each object to hold the license plate
    number for each car.
